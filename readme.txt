This is a full node app

to start:
node server.js

listens:
8080

Main issue: first ng repeat is throwing some weird error causing fake events to be pulled from a 
fake database

fix: scroll to the bottom and add your first date, that will fix the issue

final: presentation of a full node app with addition and deletion of events.
